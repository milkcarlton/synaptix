# Synaptix

Synaptix is a small configurable Linux application that binds input devices to macros. 
I wrote this as a personal substitute for Razer Synapse (Synapse + Linux => Synaptix) to work with my ancient Razer Taipan mouse, but it should work with any input device. 

I open-sourced this code for anyone else seeking something similar. It's far from perfect, but it does most of what I desired it to do as-is. That said, I'll still be renovating and developing it further in my free time. Feel free to make any suggestions or use it however you wish!
